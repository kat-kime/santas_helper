Popular books per address

There isn't an easy way to find most popular books per city and I didn't want to rewrite my code
I looked up in Piazza, and the code doesn't actually have to make sense - it just needs to feed and consume (this answer was endorsed by the professor)

That being said, I'm thinking we can create like a toy giveaway
Like a Santa's Helper application

User picks a state and how many people for each state
Random addresses

Generate a number of top toys per category (and number input

User goes to GUI
Selects state
Selects toy category
Selects #

Random addresses are sent
Top toys are generated

Passes toys + addresses

Compiles toys and addresses and puts together


Toy Giveaway

Requirements:

Category of toys

People Generator:
Receives state + number of people
Returns addresses

Receives addresses
Returns toy per address

We don't need the GUI -
